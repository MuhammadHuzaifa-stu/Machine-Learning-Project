Training Random Forest and ANN classifiers by extracting features of images using HOG, SIFT, SURF.
Actually, we were given a task to checkout the accuracy of Random Forest and ANN classifiers by using different 
feature extracting methods used by HOG, SIFT, SURF.
So, I collected data(images) of cats, dogs, horses each 202 images and then using 70% training data. I calculated 
the accurracy by using above three methods.
The performance was not that good overall HOG performed the best, almost 60% accuracy in each case, SURF was at 2nd place and SIFT at 3rd(worst performance).
